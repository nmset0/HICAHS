### (1) What is the relationship between health risk factors and worker densities in the HICAHS area?

#### i. calculate unconditional correlations between worker concentrations (e.g., totals) and fire and heat environmental exposure scales (identified on website as capturing aspects of “human risk”)

#### ii.similar correlations for other available indicators that may be of interest

#### iii. use county-level as the geo-observational unit

The correlation between heat, fire, and worker concentrations (totals):
