Overview: The new HICAHS Data Hub (https://hicahs-centroid-collaboration-csurams.hub.arcgis.com/)
provides capacity for compelling visualizations of correlations between environmental risk and worker
population concentrations in the Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming
service area. Economic valuations associated with the extent of agricultural activity (e.g., sales) can also
be visualized spatially through this Hub as can densities of healthcare services and infrastructures among
other indicators.
